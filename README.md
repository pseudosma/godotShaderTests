# Godot Shader Test

A test project for rewriting GLSL shaders in Godot Shader Language. Some of the assets are shared with [shaders](https://github.com/pseudosma/shaders).

:warning: This was built under Godot 2.x and later converted to run as a Godot 3.0 project, thus this may not work on the latest build without some tinkering. You can download the older versions of Godot [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0/).
